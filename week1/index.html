          Marijn is a software engineer. He can only use his left hand, and with
          that hand he has difficulty with fine motor control. This means typing
          can be hard for him. It’s even one of the reasons why he didn’t finish
          university. He had to write papers. Marijn is incredibly intelligent,
          so thinking up a paper is very easy. Yet typing it would take him
          ages.

          <h1 class="article__h1">The problem</h1>
          <p class="article__text">
            Basically the problem he has with keyboard layouts is that not all
            keys are next to each other. On a QWERTY keyboard it’s easy for him
            to type the word <em>was</em> because the letters are close to each
            other. Typing the word <em>is</em> is much harder though. He will
            have to move his hand and exactly point it to that one small square.

          <p class="article__text">
            After observing Marijn using his computer, Rick Buter, a student of
            mine, explored alternative ways of typing words. What if, Rick
            thought, you would only need a few keys? What if you could type
            complete sentences by only using the u, i, o, j, k, and l keys?

            And so he created a prototype where

              >with only six keys you can type common words. At first Rick
              didn’t dare to mention his idea, let alone create a working
              prototype. When he first thought of it, it simply seemed too
              ridiculous. Only when I explicitly asked my students to come up
              with nonsensical ideas did he dare to make a prototype and test
              it. When he first showed this prototype to Marijn, he had to laugh
              indeed. It looked so ridiculous and complicated, it didn&#8217;t
              seem to make any sense.</a

            Yet after trying it a few times he had to conclude that this might
            actually work. If you want to

            Allowing ideas that seem nonsensical into a design proces can lead
            to innovative products. This is a common ideation method used in
            many different creative fields. Questlove explains in his book about
            creativity that some musicians play music backwards in order to come
            up with completely new sounds.

            My personal interest in nonsense has grown while I was working at a
            large web design agency. Everything we did there had to make sense,
            by which I mean that everything had to have an easily measurable
            effect. More visitors, more money, better performance, simple things
            like that. And thus we only investigated the obvious. This always
            gave me the feeling that we were missing out on things.

            Back in 2010, as a reaction to this professional focus on
            <em>utility</em> I started a website called
            <a href="https://lovenonsense.com/">Love Nonsense</a>, in which I
            blogged about nonsensical, mostly funny but often insightful topics.
            I have worked on several nonsensical side projects as well. Like
            this
